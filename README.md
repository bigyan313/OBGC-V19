1 Billion Global Click Challenge - Project Documentation
üåü Project Overview
The 1 Billion Global Click Challenge is a revolutionary hybrid web application that demonstrates the future of decentralized community engagement. It combines the speed and accessibility of modern database technology with the permanence and transparency of blockchain technology, creating a unique "best of both worlds" experience.

üéØ Core Concept
This application challenges users worldwide to collectively reach 1 billion clicks together. Every click is:

Instantly visible through real-time database updates
Permanently stored on Solana MAINNET blockchain
Globally accessible to all participants worldwide
Cryptographically verified and immutable
üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
Hybrid Storage System
The application uses a sophisticated dual-storage architecture:

Primary: Supabase Database

Real-time global statistics
Instant leaderboard updates
Fast worldwide access
Enterprise-grade reliability
Free for all users
Secondary: Solana Blockchain

Permanent, immutable records
Uses standard Solana memo program
Cryptographically verified
Exists forever on MAINNET
Small network fees only (‚âà0.000005 SOL)
Token-Gated Participation
The application implements a bonding curve mechanism using $OBGC tokens:

Token requirements decrease as global clicks increase
Starts at 500K tokens, reduces to 5K tokens at 1B clicks
Creates economic incentives for early participation
Demonstrates advanced tokenomics integration
